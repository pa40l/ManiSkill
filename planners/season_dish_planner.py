"""Oracle for MikasaSeasonDish-v0, and its blind twin.

Written against `tools/stub_planner.py` on a Mac and run for real in the amd64 CPU
container (`tools/docker/planner.sh run …`) since 2026-08-18 (T5) — the geometry
below is what the container measured. The stage kit is `oracle_common.py` (D7);
the four poses that were `TODO(owner)` here are now built from it: the grasp from
`grasp_geometry`/`try_grasp`, the drive to the task's own bowl dock, the hover
from `pose_over`, and the pour from `pour_pose_for` (this file's one piece of
geometry of its own, pure and tested against the task's predicate arithmetic).

What the oracle does, in order, and why:

1. **Waits the cue out** (`wait_cue`, to `cfg.cue_steps` — K36; the repo rule: an
   oracle does not act through the cue) and only then reads the answer once,
   `info["target_is_shaker"]` — privileged, as `template_planner.py` allows a
   demonstrator; `--blind` replaces that read with a **uniform draw** of the
   condiment from `np.random.default_rng(seed)` (the burner's convention) and
   changes nothing else, so the arms differ only in memory (blind ≈ 0.5× sighted).
   (Until the T5 fix round it took "always the shaker" — the harder grasp — and
   scored structurally below the floor; both numbers are in the journal.)
2. **Slides the base along the counter** until the target is straight ahead
   (`dock_for_target`, K55). The station dock is drawn midway between the two
   condiments, so the target sits `station_spacing / 2` = 12 cm to one side and the
   reach is a diagonal; the slide costs a ~12 cm drive and leaves the standoff
   alone. A refusal is not fatal — the grasp from the dock as drawn is what the
   oracle did before.

3. **Grasps the target**, and keeps asking when refused (K55). First the inherited
   attempts: OBB thin side, one more draw of the same grasp (RRT is randomized),
   then the closing direction reversed. Then a ladder over the three things that
   are free to choose, cheapest first — **wrist yaw** (both condiments are bodies
   of revolution, and the shaker's 0.051 x 0.052 m footprint means the yaw the OBB
   picks is decided by a millimetre), **grip height** (+2.5 cm lifts the wrist out
   of the counter it was sweeping through), and finally **stance** (±10 cm toward
   the counter, when the refusal is a bare `IK Failed` and no wrist angle can help).
   A refused plan costs no episode steps, so the ladder is nearly free in horizon —
   only in wall clock. Verifies with `agent.is_grasping`, then reads
   `distractor_ok` off the step's info — a nudged distractor is a **miss** (D6:
   the 5-tuple, not `-1`).
4. **Attaches the object in the planning world** (`hold_object_in_planner`;
   honest since K53), **lifts** with the torso frozen to `lift_z = max(grasp.z +
   0.15, tallest condiment top + 0.10)` (K40 — the base turn carries the object
   over its neighbour), takes the object's pose in the base frame, and **drives**
   straight to the bowl dock, facing the counter — no carry pose (K57: measured
   free, 30 seeds per arm, and a quarter of the motion cheaper); `d_dock`/`dyaw`
   in the trace (K26); `distractor_ok` again.
5. **Hovers** the object origin `HOVER_ABOVE` over the bowl, upright as it was
   grasped relative to the base (`object_q_from_base` — the base turns under it),
   using `T_tcp_obj` read *after* the drive (the emulated burner showed the object
   shifting in the fingers during base turns).
6. **Pours**: `pour_pose_for` puts the object origin `POUR_ABOVE` over the bowl,
   tilted about a horizontal world axis — the candidates in order: the base's
   facing (+tilt, −tilt), then along the counter (±), first at `POUR_TILT_DEG` and
   then at `POUR_TILT_STRONG_DEG`. The second rung is for the arm that reaches the
   pose but not the angle: the predicate wants 55°, the first rung commands 65°,
   and seed 2 came to rest at 47.5° — a 10° margin against a 17.5° tracking error.
   Each executed candidate is given `POUR_SETTLE_STEPS` to come to rest before its
   angle is believed, because a tilt read mid-motion is the commanded pose's error
   rather than the object's attitude. After each the predicate's own flags are read
   from info; a plan that ran
   but did not satisfy them moves on to the next; `grasp_target` gone → a miss
   ("dropped during the tilt"); none satisfied after all candidates → a miss
   ("no pour pose reached", with the last `tilt_rad`); `-1` only if **no**
   candidate planned at all (D6).
7. **Holds**, polled in `HOLD_POLL_CHUNK` steps to `HOLD_POLL_BUDGET` and breaking
   as soon as `success` latches — `pour_hold` resets on any single step where
   `pour_now` is false, so one flicker inside a fixed window loses an episode that
   would have latched a few steps later. Returns the last 5-tuple. Every stage checks
   `stopped_by_horizon(planner)` before interpreting its result (K23).

Contract, as `template_planner.py:32-45`: the solution owns the reset; return `-1`
on a failed plan and the gym 5-tuple otherwise; do not catch exceptions; do not
decide success; do not call `env.evaluate()` — read `info` from the tuple.

# A stance rung — re-driving the base 10 cm and walking the ladder again — was built

# into a `truncated`. A flat 0.15 m advance applied from the start measures worse
# still (2/10). The reach that stance was meant to buy is bought in the task instead,
# by standing the stations clear of the sink — see `station_along` in scenes/.

# Gripping at the centre of mass, floored by clearance over the counter
# (`min(top - 0.01, max(centre, counter_top + 0.06))`), was built and withdrawn (K55).
# The reasoning is sound and the lever arm is real — `max(centre, top - GRASP_BELOW_TOP)`
# raises the 15.7 cm bottle to 4.9 cm above its centre of mass, which is what pulls it out
# of the hand during the tuck on held-out seed 29 (K57 has since deleted that tuck, so
# this particular failure may no longer exist). But gripping 2-5 cm lower costs more
# than it buys, measured: eval seed 3 then fails the *lift* (`joint limit at index [3]`,
# the torso, which the lift freezes — from a lower grip the arm alone must span more), and
# held-out seed 27 fails the grasp on `wrist_flex_link <-> counter_main`, the very
# collision GRASP_BELOW_TOP exists to avoid. Both are new failures on seeds that passed.
# The lever arm wants a fix that does not move the hand down, and that is not this one.
#
# **Re-measured on the randomized layout and still true** (K79r). K79p quantified the lever
# the analyst blamed for the topple — `max(centre, top - 0.03)` puts the pads **48.5 mm
# above the centre of mass** on the 157 mm bottle, whose whole footprint then rides above a
# free-standing object held down by friction, while the 94 mm shaker's pads straddle its CoM
# at 16.5 mm and it is never ejected that way. Gripping at the CoM instead (floored at the
# counter clearance, so it can only move *down toward* the CoM) measured **161/180 against
# 174/180** — thirteen seeds worse, grasp failures 5 -> 15. The mechanism is real and the

The last unexplained thing after K79c-K79l: IK reports **no solution** at a pose whose
neighbour one wrist rotation away plans to 3 mm, with the planning world verified in sync
(0.0 mm drift at every refusal, K79i) and the arm demonstrably able to reach the point.
`IK Failed! Cannot find valid solution` means all `n_init_qpos` seeds were rejected — so
the refusal may be about how many starting configurations the solver tried, not about
whether a solution exists. The solver already raises this elsewhere for the same reason
(`move_base_forward(..., n_init_qpos=100)`).

**Two companion fixes were tried; neither works** (K79n, K79u). And the combination this
journal proposed as its own handoff is now measured and **wrong**: K79s removed the drops
(its control arm shows zero), so raising `n_init_qpos` on top of it should have kept the
recovered grasps without the cost. It does not — **169/180 against 174/180, five seeds
worse, and the drops stay at five**. The extra drops are not the crush-past-contact kind
K79s fixes; they are genuinely marginal grasps, and dropping is simply how that fragility
shows. Stopping the close cannot make a marginal IK solution hold.

**The first companion fix** (K79n). Raising this converts
grasp failures but adds `dropped during the lift` ones, so the natural next move is to ask
IK for the solution *nearest the current configuration* rather than any solution
(`SapienPlannerV2.IK(..., return_closest=True)`), on the theory that the extra solutions
are contorted arm poses. Plumbed end to end and measured: **both seeds that pass at
n_init_qpos=100 fail with it on.** The reason is in the API, not the physics —
`return_closest` collapses IK's *list* of goal configurations to a single one, so
RRTConnect is handed one goal state instead of many and plans worse. Withdrawn, and the
shared-solver plumbing reverted with it.

**So was the second companion fix** (K79o). If the extra solutions give bad *grips*, score the
grip: the two prismatic finger joints open to 0.05 each, so their sum is the aperture, and a
real hold on a 5.1 cm shaker keeps them near 0.051 while a hold on the lip closes them much
further. `is_grasping` reports that contact exists, not that the hold is good. Measured on the
seeds that drop at `n_init_qpos=100`: on seed 6 the gate **fires** and the ladder still finds
nothing better; on seed 55 it **does not fire** and the object drops anyway. Aperture is
neither sufficient nor actionable here — a drop during the lift is not predicted by how wide
the fingers ended up."""

The last untried lead from K79p, and the second change all session to actually move the
rate. The fingers are **position**-commanded: they reach exactly 0.0000 aperture in both
measured drop runs and never reopen, so a contact that begins to slip simply lets them close
further — on seed 6 a 45 mm bottle ends pinched at 21 mm, mid-topple, levered over by the
closing motion itself while the arm moves 0.4 mm. Polling `is_grasping` after each step and
stopping there ends the close typically at step 2 of 6.

**The other half of that recommendation — *slow* the closure — was tried and is worse**
(K79w): ramping the command toward CLOSED over 6 steps instead of stepping to it measures
174/180 against 176/180, and puts a drop back. The contact test fires while the ramp is a
third of the way in, so the grip at the stop is lighter; gentleness costs more than the slam
did. This change already has the useful half.

Measured, 180 seeds per arm interleaved, **two independent runs** (the standard K79's budget
had to meet — one favourable sweep is what produced the K79j disaster):

| | fixed close | stop on contact |
|---|---|---|
| run 1 | 173/180, 7 failures | **175/180, 5** |
| run 2 | 171/180, 9 failures | **174/180, 6** |

Same direction both times, and the gain lands where the mechanism predicts: one `dropped
during the lift` per run against two or more in the control.

**Partial by construction, and deliberately left so** (K79t). `self.gripper_state` stays
CLOSED afterwards — which on this `PDJointPosMimicController` targets `lower = -0.01 m`,
commanding the fingers *past shut* for every later step. Completing the fix by re-aiming that
standing command at the width the fingers actually reached (minus a 2 mm squeeze) was built
and measured: **173/180 against 175/180**, two seeds worse, and it grows failures the control
does not have — `FAILED: drive to bowl dock` and `carry pose unreachable`, which is what a
looser grip does to an object being carried. The control arm shows **zero** drops, so this

four of them are this exact mechanism: `the object has moved since the first grasp`, by
7 to 12 cm, after which no wrist yaw and no grip height has a solution. Probed on all six
failing seeds, three ways:

    as shipped (open hand)          0 / 6
    fingers shut for the transit    6 / 6
    abort on first touch            0 / 6

Six of six — and the six were chosen BECAUSE they failed with the open hand, so any change
that perturbs the trajectory was going to recover some of them. That is not validation,
it is the selection speaking.

The paired run says so plainly. Same 200 unseen seeds, same commit, the flag the only
difference (`runs/2026-09-05-final2` against `runs/2026-09-05-sd-paired`):

    open hand   195/200      b = 6 seeds only the open hand wins
    shut hand   194/200      c = 5 seeds only the shut hand wins

A wash, and the six it fixes are not the six it breaks. It also costs a close and an open
per rung. So the shipped default stays as it was, and what remains true from the probe is
narrower than it looked: the shut hand changes WHICH seeds fail, not how many.

`ABORT_ON_TOUCH` was probed in the same run and recovered 0 of 6 — that one is a real
negative, and the reason is in the mechanism: the contact IS the nudge, so aborting on it
is always too late.

Measured from SAPIEN's own contact reports rather than inferred from trajectories: on
seeds 61, 129, 136 and 177 the first robot-shaker contact is `r_gripper_finger_link` or
`l_gripper_finger_link` **every time**, 1-15 steps before the object starts moving, with
peak impulses 0.005-0.248. Never the wrist, never the forearm, never the gripper body
first. The thing that topples the shaker is a fingertip.

The oracle holds the hand **fully open** — 0.05 per finger, 10 cm of aperture — for the
whole approach, though the fingers only need to be open at the standoff, 10 cm short of
the target. Closing for the transit halves the swept width exactly where it clips. Costs
one `close_gripper` and one `open_gripper` per rung (about 12 steps) and moves no target
pose, so it is neither a geometry change nor a timing one."""

this closes the question: the follower sends one row of `result["position"]` per control
step, so interpolating rows halves the commanded joint delta per step without changing a
single waypoint the planner chose. Tracking lag is set by that delta.

alone, which is the version whose cost is bounded: `(factor - 1) * knots` steps on one
leg, against ~500 of 1100 an episode uses.

**MEASURED 2026-09-05 AND IT LOSES.** The bounded version was finally run, paired, 200
seeds per arm on the same commit (`runs/2026-09-05-stretch`, seeds 300-499, incomplete 0):

    stretch 1   194/200    missed 3  no plan 3  truncated 0
    stretch 2   190/200    missed 2  no plan 5  truncated 3
    b = 7 seeds only the normal speed wins, c = 3 only the slow one

The reasoning was sound and the number says no. The horizon is where it goes: three
episodes truncate that never truncated before, and the leg it slows is the long one.

APPROACH_DRAWS = int(os.environ.get("MIKASA_APPROACH_DRAWS", "1"))
"""RRT draws the approach leg takes before choosing one (K80). 1 = shipped; **3 is worse**.

The defect this was built for is K67's, and it is still there. mplib gives OMPL one
weight-1 subspace per joint, so `maxExtent` is the plain sum of the joint ranges
(**132.01**, of which `root_x`/`root_y` contribute 80 at +/-20 m) and
`longestValidSegment = maxExtent * 0.01 = 1.32` rad — longer than every edge RRTConnect
draws at `rrt_range=0.1`, so **the interior of a path is validated at its endpoints
alone**. Measured again here on the shipped configuration, with `MIKASA_SKIM_REPORT=1`
and the folded-qpos convention `check_for_env_collision` actually wants: **48% of
approach legs command a trajectory that intrudes on the world**, mid-path rather than at
either end (held-out seed 83: knots 31-111 of 181, `l_gripper_finger<->condiment_bottle`
on 49 of them and `<->keepout_1` on 58). K76's keep-out is in the world and the path goes
straight through it. The furniture is hit more often than the condiments are.

Draws to the same goal differ, so selection has something real to act on — unlike K65,
which selected on knot count and so on the simplifier's B-spline subdivision. A clean
draw existed for **74%** of legs, and taking it cut mean intruded knots 7.9 -> 3.3.

**And the rate went down.** 180 seeds per arm, interleaved in one pool:

| | dev 0-79 | held 80-179 | total | new modes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 draw (shipped)** | **78/80** | 96/100 | **174/180** | - |
| 3 draws | 75/80 | **97/100** | 172/180 | 2 dropped in lift, 1 in tilt |

Two seeds worse and +24% episode wall clock (79 s -> 98 s), with three drop failures the
control arm does not have. This is the **third** independent way of removing the strike
(K66 `simplify=False`, K67 verify-then-replan, this) and the third to move the rate by
nothing or less. The strike is real, quantified and not the binding constraint.

Left at 1 — byte-identical to the code before K80 — with the override kept so the sweep
is cheap to repeat, as `MIKASA_GRASP_PAD` and `MIKASA_RRT_RANGE` are. The measurement
half (`MIKASA_SKIM_REPORT`, `MikasaFetchSolver.path_env_collisions`) is

Must exceed the controller's tracking error and stay under the 0.10 m standoff. The
measured error is 2-7 deg of joint lag, 7-9 cm of Cartesian deviation at a 0.7 m
extension, against approach paths OMPL itself reports as "slightly touching ... but it
was successfully fixed" — 0.9 cm of skin clearance on one measured seed. 3 cm invalidates
that homotopy while leaving 7 cm of standoff, so the pre-grasp pose stays reachable.

**Widening it to 5 cm was measured and is worse** (K79c). The argument for widening is
sound and came from two per-seed post-mortems: the proxy radius at 3 cm is `ext/2 + pad`
= 5.6 cm against executed deviations of 6.4 cm, which is how the gripper clips a *standing*
shaker on seed 61 and knocks it flat — after which no IK exists for the fallen body and
every later refusal is honest. 5 cm keeps the radius (7.6 cm) inside the 10 cm standoff, so
it is legal. Measured anyway, 180 seeds per arm interleaved in one pool:

dock` and 2x `FAILED: carry pose unreachable`. A wider proxy picks a different approach
path, which lands a different grasp, which cascades into stages downstream of it — K65's
finding that perturbing this planner's path reshuffles rather than reduces. The clipping is

    Why (K59): a parallel jaw closing on a 5.1 cm circle grips identically at every

    spends it anyway — it aims the approach down the OBB's *longer* horizontal axis,
    which for a near-round footprint is decided by mesh noise and tracks the spawn yaw.
    Measured over 30 seeds x 2 objects, the angle between that axis and the base->object
    ray is uniform: mean 46.7 deg, median 46.7, 73% above 30 deg, 8% below 10. The arm
    was being sent to a wrist yaw ~47 deg off the line it reaches along, for nothing.

    Falls back to `default_grasp_info` when the footprint is elongated (the yaw is not
    free) or when `ee_direction` has no horizontal part — the top-down rescue rung
    passes ``[0, 0, -1]`` and must keep the frame it was measured with.

    The grip depth uses the footprint's mean radius rather than the OBB's support width
    along `approaching`: for a near-circular footprint that width grows toward the OBB
    corners, which would grip a chord instead of the diameter at 45 deg.

plan is not what touches it: the approach is planned with the condiments inflated 3 cm,
giving 5.6 cm of proxy radius, against an EXECUTED deviation of 6.4 cm (K79c). That
deviation is joint lag, and joint lag grows with extension: the 6.4 cm was measured at a
0.7 m reach. A base that steps in does not need the extension.

Every lever that attacks the symptom has now been measured and none pays: keepout pad at
5 cm worse (K79c), three approach draws worse (K80), narrow approach a wash, abort on
touch 0 of 6, the skim refusal keeps only the gross cases, the slowed approach worse and
truncating. This one attacks the cause — and it is a wash too.

the FIRST reach, not the fallback, and that is a different change with a different cost.

    # the shaker's axis and a finger clips it. So aim the search 10 cm ABOVE the standoff,

                # Before the arc: come at the object from above instead of level with

                # still standing rather than ninth after it is flat — was built and withdrawn
                # (K79k). The gap was real: on seed 71 the three top-down rungs aim at z 0.942,
                # 2.2 cm over the worktop, because the object is already toppled by then, and
                # top-down at its *standing* pose (z 0.984, 6.4 cm clearance) had never been
                # tried. It fires (the trace shows `from above (early)`) and **both persistent
                # failures still fail**, so no sweep was spent on it: a rescue that does not
                # convert the two seeds it was built for has no mechanism left to help a
                # population. **And tried again, conditionally,
                # in K79j** — top-down first only when the grip sits under 9 cm over the
                # worktop, which selects the shaker (6.45 cm) and not the bottle (12.67 cm).
                # The motivation was sound: both persistent failures target the shaker, 0 of
                # 12 bottle-target episodes fail, and five `wrist_flex_link<->counter_main`
                # refusals say the level approach drags the wrist through the counter. Seed
                # 71 — which had resisted every other intervention that day — passed with it.
                # The population did not: dev 78->67/80, held 95->89/100, **173 -> 156/180**,
                # 24 failures against 7. One seed passing is not evidence. This stays a rung,

                # exists to lift the wrist out of the counter, and a hand coming straight
