"""Oracle for MikasaDepthRecall-v1 — five transfers built from two measured flows.

Each transfer is one of the two strokes this branch measured at 100/100:

- **extract** (shelf -> counter slot) is `cabinet_retrieval_planner`'s straight flow,
- **restore** (counter slot -> shelf) is `cabinet_stow_planner`'s.

Nothing is re-derived: the docks, `GRASP_LIFT`, the depth ladder, `ready_by_line` and
its pre-checks, the loaded hold and the lift-off all come from those files. What is new
here is only the sequencing and the one lateral fact that makes it work — with the base
docked at the object's own x, the arm reaches sideways far enough that NO transfer ever
carries a prop while the base moves (measured 2026-09-10: onto the counter 36 cm toward
smaller x, into the shelf 36 cm toward larger x, both 5/5).

**Where the answer is read, and it is one line.** The extraction order is taken from the
props' own poses — front first, which physics enforces anyway — so it needs no
privileged information. The only privileged read is the RESTORE assignment: which staged
prop belongs in which row slot. `choose_assignment` reads `task.original_slots` when
sighted and draws when blind, and `--blind` swaps exactly that. The coins come from
`default_rng(seed + 10_007)`, never from the episode RNG, or they alias the ticket
(CabinetSearch's recorded trap).

Contract: `solve(env, seed=None, debug=False, vis=False, blind=False)` returning -1 (no
plan) or the gym 5-tuple, per `template_planner.py`.

#: Metres the unshelve ALSO travels back along the approach axis, so the leg separates

#:
#: Measured 2026-09-10, first run of this task: the row pitch is 5.5 cm and a prop is
#: 4.5 cm across, so 1 cm of air separates two bodies — and the finger plates reach
#: ~3 cm past the TCP along the approach. A pure +z unshelve was refused at step 1 with
#: `l_gripper_finger_link <-> prop_1`, `0.005 of the twist left`, on every draw. Going
#: up AND back moves the fingers off the neighbour's face from the first knot.
UNSHELVE_BACK = float(os.environ.get("MIKASA_DR1_UNSHELVE_BACK", "0.06"))

#: Where the TCP sits above a prop's mid-height, tried in order.
#:
#: The retrieval family's single `GRASP_LIFT` (0.02) exists to keep `wrist_flex_link`,
#: which hangs 6.7 cm under the hand's axis, off the surface — and on a 12 cm prop it
#: leaves only 1.3 cm. Measured 2026-09-10, seed 9: every one of 75 IK solutions for a
#: counter grasp was refused with `gripper_link <-> counter_main`, because the props
#: already standing beside it had taken away the branches that clear. The higher rungs
#: are `depth_recall_planner`'s own measured top band (its `GRASP_Z_LADDER` is
#: 0.045/0.055/0.035), where the prop's own body is the support under the pads.

#: Torso heights the lateral cross is tried at, in order. `None` means "wherever the
#: carry-out left it" — the first rung is free, the rest cost a joint line.
#:
#: The ladder stops at 0.20 on purpose: there the carried prop's base rides at 1.25,
#: which is 21 cm over the tops of the props already standing on the slots. Going lower
#: buys reach and starts sweeping them.
CROSS_TORSO_RUNGS = (None, 0.30, 0.20)

#: Joint-space step the TORSO lines are planned with, metres.
#:
#: `plan_qpos_line`'s default is 0.1, which for a 0.386 m torso ride is four knots and
#: therefore four control steps — about 9.6 cm asked per step. Under
#: `pd_joint_delta_pos` the channel caps at 0.1 per step, so the command SATURATES:
#: measured 2026-09-10 on seed 0, the torso action sat at |a| = 1.000 on 1.1 % of the
#: episode's steps while the joint actually moved at most 3.35 cm. That is the "base
#: dropping sharply" in the clip, and at the 10 Hz recording clock it gets worse, not
#: better. 0.02 asks ~2 cm a step, a fifth of the channel.
#:
#: The arm never clips at either step size (0.000 % on all seven channels, same run).
TORSO_LINE_STEP = float(os.environ.get("MIKASA_DR1_TORSO_STEP", "0.02"))

#: Largest torso move issued as ONE joint line, metres; longer rides are chunked.
#:
#: The line's own knots are already fine (22-26 for a 0.386 m ride, ~1.5 cm each), so
#: the per-step speed is set by the follower, not the plan — and the follower is shared
#: with every other task here. Chunking is the part this oracle owns: a short line
#: cannot build up the same advance.
TORSO_CHUNK = float(os.environ.get("MIKASA_DR1_TORSO_CHUNK", "0.08"))

#: Torso heights the RESTORE's lateral cross is tried at, in order.
#:
#: The cross has to thread a band, and both walls are measured. Too HIGH and it hits
#: the closed LEFT door: seed 18 crossed 36 cm west with the torso at its 0.386 stop,
#: which puts the hand near z 1.5, and the door's panel occupies z 1.39-2.31 below
#: x = 2.25 — every posture was refused with
#: `l_gripper_finger_link <-> cab_main..._hingeleftdoor`. Too LOW and it sweeps the
#: props already standing on the slots, whose tops are 12 cm above the counter: seed 6
#: tipped the prop it was on its way to. The middle rungs put the hand between the two,
#: and the previous height is kept as the last resort so nothing that used to plan
#: stops planning.
