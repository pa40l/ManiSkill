"""MikasaDepthRecall-v1: take the deepest prop out, stage the row on the COUNTER, put it back.

The owner's rewrite of `MikasaDepthRecall-v0`, 2026-09-09: build it on the retrieval
straight flow, stage the removed props on FOUR counter slots instead of inside the
cabinet, let the slot be drawn at RANDOM so the row cannot be restored by queue order,
and return everything except the last prop taken out, which is the one the chore asked
for. The design blank is `docs/task-designs/H-depthrecall-v1.md`.

**What the rewrite is for.** v0 staged the removed props on a fixed line inside the
cabinet and recorded the cost with open eyes: "the agent's own staging layout can
encode the answer (a LIFO/queue convention solves the restore without internal
memory)". That convention is learnable in the weights, so v0's blind floor was an
oracle-relative control rather than a bound. Drawing the counter slot per episode makes
the staged arrangement statistically independent of the row's order, and a fixed rule
stops working: to put a prop back you have to remember where it came from.

**The chore.** Three props stand one behind another on the shelf, front to deep. The
front one hides the others, so the arrangement is not visible at t=0 and is learned by
taking the row apart. Each prop that comes out is stood on one of four counter slots,
drawn. The DEEPEST prop is the target: it stays on the counter. The other two go back
into their OWN row slots — and physics settles the order, since nothing can be placed
behind an occupied slot.

**Reachability is why the slots sit WEST of the row** (measured 2026-09-10, and this is
a task definition, not a tuning knob): with the base docked at the object's own x, the
arm places into the SHELF up to 36 cm toward larger x (5/5) but is refused past 6 cm
toward smaller x, because the closed left door walls off that side; on the COUNTER,
placing up to 30 cm toward smaller x is 5/5. So an extraction docks at the row and
reaches west onto the counter, a restore docks at the slot and reaches east into the
row, and the base only ever moves with an EMPTY hand. No transit carries a prop.

Conventions: `docs/writing-tasks.md`, AGENTS.md "Writing a memory task". Where this
departs from `template_task.py` the comment says why.
