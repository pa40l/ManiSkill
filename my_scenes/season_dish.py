"""Season the dish — a memory task in a RoboCasa kitchen, driven by Fetch.

The chore: a bowl waits on the counter and two condiments stand at a station
further along it. A recipe marker shows which condiment the dish needs, then
disappears. The robot must fetch **that** condiment, hold it over the bowl,
tip it past an angle, and keep it there.

What makes it a memory task rather than a pick-and-place with a colour:

- the answer is drawn per episode and is visible only while `elapsed_steps <
  cue_steps`. After that the marker is at z = 1000 and the post-cue observation
  is *identical* under swapping the answer;
- the two condiments swap sides per episode, so "always go left" is worth 50 %,
  not 100 %;
- success requires the wrong condiment to be left untouched at its spawn. Without
  that clause a memoryless policy seasons with both and wins every time. That one
  predicate — `distractor_ok` in evaluate() — is what makes the 50 % ceiling true,
  and it is the first thing to check if a blind baseline ever scores higher.

**Not simulated: any substance.** SAPIEN has no granular or fluid physics here, so
"seasoning" is a pose predicate — the condiment held above the bowl and tilted.
That is a proxy and the task says so rather than implying otherwise.

The memoryless baseline is not an argument, it is an experiment: run the same
scripted solution twice, once reading `env.unwrapped.target_is_shaker` and once
always taking the shaker. The task is only validated when the second scores about
half the first at the same failed_motion_plan_rate.

Conventions and the reasons for them: docs/writing-tasks.md and AGENTS.md
"Writing a memory task". Where this file departs from template_task.py, the
comment says why.

        # happened to stand. Clearing it is a height problem — a ray from (out=D, up=h)
        # passes the robot at `0.92 + (0.83/D)·h` against its ~1.55 m — and the cheapest

        Rejection sampling over `usable_counter_regions` — jezv's free area, ported —
        under three constraints, all of which are load-bearing:

        1. **Reach.** `cfg.reach_band` from the dock. The counter's usable band reaches
           1.17 m from the dock at its back edge, which no plan survives; the fixed
           layout sat at 0.833 m (K71). The dock slides along the counter to the object,
           so what this really bounds is how deep on the counter a thing may sit.
        2. **Separation.** `cfg.min_object_gap` between every pair, so the bowl (25.6 cm
           across) never overlaps a seasoning and the gripper can get between them.
        3. **Station pairing.** The two seasonings stay `cfg.station_spacing` apart on
           the counter's `along` axis, because the task's whole point is a cue that
           picks one of two *interchangeable* stations; scattering them independently
           would make "which one" a different question.

        Returns `(bowl, left, right, fell_back)`. On exhaustion it returns the fixed
        layout with `fell_back=True` rather than an out-of-reach draw — and says so in
        `info`, because a silent fallback would quietly measure the old task.

           an image policy the answer in clean symbolic form and the marker becomes
