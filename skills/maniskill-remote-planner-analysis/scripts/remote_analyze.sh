# Run a ManiSkill planner across N seeds on a remote host (gangway) with W
# parallel workers, pull the run logs back, and list the failed runs.
#
# The run happens in an isolated git worktree on the remote so it never
# disturbs the remote's main checkout; everyone else's work (and the venv at
# $REMOTE_REPO/.venv) is left untouched.
#
# Usage: remote_analyze.sh <planner_module> <seed_count> <workers> [remote_host] [remote_repo]
#   planner_module  Python module under planners/, e.g. myrobocasa_fridge_veggies_planner
#   seed_count      number of seeds to run (1..N)
#   workers         how many seeds to run in parallel (1..N)
#   remote_host     ssh alias (default: gangway)
#   remote_repo     remote clone that holds the working .venv (default: ~/ManiSkill)
#
# Env: NO_VIDEO=1 appends --no-video to every remote run (skips render, ~5-10x
# faster). Use it for any batch with workers >= 10.
