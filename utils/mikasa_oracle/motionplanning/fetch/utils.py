    mplib 0.2.1 draws an attached body at ``link_in_base_frame * attached_pose`` —

    at construction and at every ``update_from_simulation``; then mplib's own
    ``link.inv() * entity.pose`` *is* the rigid link->object transform and the body is
    drawn where the hand is in every configuration. ``fold_qpos`` / ``unfold_qpos``
    are the two-way translation ``SapienPlannerV2`` applies at its boundary, so
    callers keep passing and receiving simulator qpos. (``unfold_rates`` and

    the unfold moved *before* TOPP in ``plan_pose``/``plan_qpos`` — the rates come

    planar root joints — a fixed-base arm — or a root pose with height/tilt, which

        K61. For a joint-space goal the straight line **is** the minimum-rotation path:
        joint limits are box constraints, so a segment between two in-limit points
        cannot leave them, and every joint moves monotonically by exactly its share of
        the difference — no joint can wind. `plan_qpos` hands the same request to
        RRTConnect, which samples the whole move-group space and returns *a* path, and
        the w10 meter priced that freedom: `fold to the rest keyframe` alone carried
        16 159 deg of tip rotation across the v9 sweep, second only to the levelling,
        for a stage whose goal is a fixed keyframe.

        So this is tried before RRT, not instead of it: the one thing a straight line
        cannot do is go around an obstacle, so each knot is collision-checked against
        the planning world (attached cup included, exactly as `plan_screw` checks its
        knots) and the first colliding knot refuses the whole line with the pair named.
        The caller falls back to `plan_qpos` and nothing reachable becomes unreachable.

        Both qpos are the FULL simulator vector, as `plan_screw` takes them, and both
        are **folded at entry exactly as `plan_screw` folds its own** (K53): the
        planning world holds the articulation at the identity with the robot's world
        pose folded into the root joints, so folded root values are the only ones its
        collision check places correctly. The first version of this method skipped the
        fold and unfolded never-folded columns at the end — the adversarial review of
        the K61 diff caught both, before a sweep was spent on them: collision checks
        against a phantom robot pose (refusing every line from a docked robot, which is
        exactly what the pilot showed — 0 lines planned in 3 episodes), and root
        columns shifted by the full inverse base transform, which
        `check_body_base_close_to_target` then never matches, spinning the refinement
        loop to its cap on every execution. The path is stepped at `qpos_step` in
        move-group norm (plan_screw's own resolution), collision-checked folded,
        unfolded into the simulator's root frame before timing, and TOPP-timed.

            max_iters: give up after this many Jacobian steps
                (``screw plan failed: no convergence after N step(s), ...``). One
                step is 0.1 in joint-space norm; the inherited cup planner's
                alignment screw ran 377 before it collided (docs/lab-journal.md,
                2026-08-18), so 200 is a bound on the pathological case, not a
                budget the good ones approach.
            goal_tolerance: ``(metres, radians)``. When given, a plan whose forward
                kinematics ends further than this from ``goal_pose`` is reported as
                ``screw plan failed: converged X cm / Y deg from the goal ...`` instead
                of ``Success``. Off by default (``None``): the screw integration is a
                first-order approximation and can "converge" far from the goal (the
                burner oracle's hover on seed 3: Success, 12.9 cm off), so callers that
                execute the whole plan and have a fallback — ``static_manipulation``
                (then ``plan_pose``) and ``lift_hand`` — pass a tolerance;
                ``move_base_forward``, which executes only the base part of the plan
                (``follow_moving_forward`` drives the base and holds the arm) and whose
                FK endpoint therefore says nothing about what the robot will do, must
                not. ``rotate_base_z`` is not on either list any more: since K51/D12 it
                does not plan with a screw at all (``base_yaw.py``).

        Returns:
            dict with ``status``; on ``Success`` also the TOPP trajectory
            (``time``, ``position``, ``velocity``, ``acceleration``, ``duration``),
            ``goal_error=(metres, radians)`` of the plan's last knot against
            ``goal_pose`` and ``iterations``. Every failure status starts with
            ``screw plan failed``.
