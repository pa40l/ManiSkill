"""The base turn as a yaw-only path: a trapezoid over one joint, and its swept arc checked.

Why this exists (K51 / D12, docs/lab-journal.md 2026-08-18)
--------------------------------------------------------------
`MikasaFetchSolver.rotate_base_z` used to ask `plan_screw` for a
whole-body plan that rotates the TCP about the base's z axis and then executed only
the base-yaw velocity of it (`follow_rotation` writes `qvel[2]` and holds the arm).
The pseudo-inverse put about a third of the turn into the base and the rest into
the arm — an arm motion the robot never made — and the collision check ran over
that phantom motion: with the torso free it hid a real cup-against-the-wall sweep,
with the torso masked it refused a drive on a collision the robot would not have
had. Nothing about a base turn needs a whole-body plan: the path is one joint, its
timing follows that joint's velocity/acceleration limits, and what must be checked
for collision is the robot as it is, swept along the arc, with whatever it holds.

Everything here is mplib-free and pure, so it can be tested on a Mac against a
stubbed collision checker; the solver supplies the real one (the planning world's
`check_robot_collision` + `check_self_collision` on the current full qpos with the
yaw substituted). `yaw_trapezoid` gives the timing, `sweep_yaw` chooses the side and
names the obstacle when neither side is free, and `HeldBodies` puts whatever the
robot is holding where physics has it before either of them means anything.

Example:
    >>> t, off, rate, T = yaw_trapezoid(0.9, v_max=0.9, a_max=0.9, dt=0.05)
    >>> round(T, 2), round(float(off[-1]), 6), float(rate[-1])
    (2.0, 0.9, 0.0)
    >>> sweep_yaw(1.0, lambda off: None)                       # nothing in the way
    (1.0, None)
    >>> sweep_yaw(1.0, lambda off: "cup<->wall" if off > 0 else None)[0]   # go round the other way
    -5.283185307179586
    >>> sweep_yaw(1.0, lambda off: "cup<->wall")[0] is None       # both ways blocked
    True

    its ±6.28 rad URDF stop (`fetch.urdf:40`) and every later turn plays its whole

    from either stop. With the stop term the guard fires **zero** times across every

class HeldBodies:
    """The planning world's attached bodies, drawn where physics actually has them.

    A swept-arc check is only worth as much as the pose it draws the held object at,
    and mplib 0.2.1 gets that pose wrong in two independent ways (both measured in the
    container on 2026-08-18, docs/lab-journal.md):

    1. **Frame.** An attached body is placed at `link_pose_in_base_frame *
       attached_pose` — the articulation's base pose is left out, while the robot's own
       FCL links do get it. With the robot spawned away from the world origin the held
       cup therefore orbits *the origin* as the base yaws: gripper at (2.79, −1.16),
       cup drawn at (0.00, −1.96), a phantom `cup<->wall_left_room`.
    2. **Staleness.** `attached_pose` is `link.inv() * object_world_pose` captured by
       the last `update_from_simulation`, so it is a rigid link→object transform only
       at the configuration it was captured in. Read it after the base has moved and
       `get_global_pose()` returns `link_new * link_old.inv() * object_world_old` —
       displaced by `2·sin(Δθ/2)·|base translation|`, metres for any real drive. This
       is why `sync` is a required argument and is called before anything is read: the
       correction below cannot be built from a stale snapshot, and the caller that
       most needs it (the residual turn of `rotate_base_z`, right after
       `follow_rotation` has turned the base ~1.6 rad) is exactly the one whose
       planning world is out of date.

    `place()` redraws every held body for the articulation's current configuration and
    `restore()` puts mplib's own `attached_pose` back, so the planner is left as found.
    Duck-typed on mplib's `Pose` (`inv()`, `*`) and `PlanningWorld` / `AttachedBody`,
    so it is testable on a Mac against fakes — see `tests/test_solver_stepping.py`.

    Since K53 (T5, `root_frame.py`): `SapienPlanningWorldV2` folds the robot's world
    pose into its root joints, so the planned articulation's base pose *is* the
    identity, mplib's own composition is right in every configuration, and the
    frame correction (1) here reduces to a no-op (`true_rel` == mplib's attached
    pose, `place()` redraws the body where it already is). The sync (2) is what
    still matters. Callers pass `art.get_base_pose()` — the identity when folded,
    the real base pose for a world that cannot fold (fixed-base arm, non-planar
    root) — so this stays correct either way.

    Args:
        world: the planning world (`get_object_names`, `is_object_attached`,
            `get_attached_object`).
        base_pose: the planned articulation's base pose *as the planning world holds
            it* (`art.get_base_pose()`).
        sync: the planner's `update_from_simulation`, called **first**. It keeps every
            attachment (mplib only rewrites `attached_body.pose` from the simulator's
            entity pose), so nothing has to be re-attached afterwards.

    """One step of the K103 arc-pull law: the unicycle's exact (v, omega) for a TCP
    that must move along the tangent of a circle about a vertical hinge.

    The base action's two channels are ego velocities applied together (a true arc
    per step), but the base is a unicycle — no lateral velocity — so the TCP's
    desired world velocity `u` is produced through the lever `r = p - b`:
    `v_tcp = v*f_hat + omega*(z_hat x r)`. In body axes that is two equations in two
    unknowns with the exact solution
    `omega = (u . l_hat) / a_x`, `v = (u . f_hat) + omega * a_y`,
    where a_x/a_y are the lever's forward/left components. a_x is the forward lever;
    the caller must stop when it collapses (the arm pose is gone) — the division is
    floored rather than allowed to explode so one bad read cannot command a spin.

    Measured (W14, K103): this law opened the wall cabinet to 1.356 rad with a live
    grip against 0.55 for a straight pull, tracking the scanned handle bar to 0 mm.

    Args:
        p_xy: world TCP position, xy.
        base_xy: world base position, xy (root_x/root_y — valid while the robot's
            root pose is identity, which every task in this repo pins).
        psi: base yaw (root_z_rotation), radians.
        anchor_xy: the hinge axis, xy (see `oracle_common.hinge_anchor`).
        sense: +1 if +qpos rotation is CCW about world +z, else -1.
        v_handle: handle speed along its tangent, m/s.
        radial_bias: optional outward preload, m/s (default 0 — measured unneeded).

    Returns:
        (v, omega, a_x): physical units — m/s, rad/s, and the forward lever in m.
        NOT action-slot values: the omega channel is normalized, see
        `extand.MikasaFetchSolver.follow_arc`.

    Example:
        >>> v, omega, a_x = arc_pull_cmd(
        ...     [2.302, -0.435], [2.300, -1.300], np.pi / 2, [2.735, -0.400],
        ...     sense=1, v_handle=0.05)
        >>> round(v, 3), omega < 0, round(a_x, 2)
        (-0.05, True, 0.86)
