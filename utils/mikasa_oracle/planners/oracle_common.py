"""The stage kit shared by the memory-task oracles, extracted from burner_planner.py.

One module because the three oracles (burner, season dish, station checklist) repeat
the same staging skeleton: announce a stage, wait the cue out, grasp something,
tell the planning world about it, and stop the moment the horizon truncates the
episode. Everything here is generalised over *which* object is held — the burner
passes `task.cup`, season dish its bottle — and everything mplib-flavoured is
imported inside the function that needs it, so this module imports on a Mac and the
offline stage tests run the real staging against `tools/stub_planner.py`.

Contract reminders that bind every caller (template_planner.py, and D6 of the
2026-08-18 plan): `-1` means the oracle gave up before a decision — a planning or
grasp failure only. A physical miss (the object landed on the wrong target, a
distractor moved, a commit did not latch) returns the last gym 5-tuple, so the
sweep books it as `missed`, not `no_plan`. And the horizon is checked with
`stopped_by_horizon(planner)` after every primitive, *before* interpreting its
result — a stage cut off by the horizon must be returned as the truncated tuple,
never misread as a failed plan.

Kept on purpose, unused in production since K53: `capture_refusal` / `_Tee` and
`carry_pose(after=...)` were the D13 seam ("carry only after a named drive refusal")
and no shipped oracle calls them now that the carry is a full stage (K52). They stay
because the seam is the documented fallback if a task ever needs the conditional
carry again, and `tests/test_oracle_common.py` keeps them honest; delete both together
with those tests if that day never comes.

    Why this exists, measured. An approach RRTConnect returns is collision-free only in
    the binary sense, and `simplify=True` shortcutting pulls the path **taut against**
    the obstacle set — OMPL says so itself on the offending plan: ``The solution path
    was slightly touching on an invalid region of the state space, but it was
    successfully fixed``. Per-seed post-mortems put numbers on it: 0.9 cm of skin
    clearance at the closest sampled state on one seed, against a pd_joint_pos
    controller carrying 2-7 deg of tracking lag — 7-9 cm of Cartesian error at a 0.7 m
    extension. A path legal by millimetres executes as a collision, and a 9.4 cm shaker
    on a 4.5 cm base topples rather than slides. Six of the nine failing seeds on the
    randomized layout are that one mechanism.

    Padding defeats it without depending on the checker's resolution: an inflated proxy
    makes the whole marginal homotopy invalid, so the planner routes wide instead of
    skimming. `pad` must exceed the tracking error and stay under the standoff, or the
    pre-grasp pose itself becomes unreachable.

    **That standoff ceiling binds only the actor being approached** (K79c). With a 0.10 m
    standoff and 7-9 cm of tracking error there is no legal pad for the *target* — but the
    distractor is never approached, so nothing caps its pad, and it is the object whose
    displacement voids the episode (`distractor_ok`). Hence `pad` accepts a sequence
    parallel to `actors` as well as a single float: measured on seed 71, an approach leg
    executed with `tcp_err=0.064 m` inside a 0.03 m pad and pushed the distractor 0.1136 m,
    past `distractor_move_tol` at step 420 — 424 steps before the episode ended, so every
    grasp attempt after that was already playing for nothing.

    RRTConnect stops the moment its two trees meet and never improves the path

    wall-clock cost of widening it is small (K79: +4.5% median episode) while the

    K55, and the reason is the shape of the waste rather than its size. A single
    long plan lets RRT wander: over a water-plants pair the hand travels 2557 deg
    against 858 deg of net per-stage change, a 3.0x detour, and `hover over the
    bucket` ends **1.3 deg** from where it started having travelled **269**. Broken
    into short hops the planner has far less room to wander between the ends, and —
    more importantly — `plan_screw`, which is a straight line in SE(3) and barely
    rotates at all, succeeds much more often on a short move than a long one, so
    more of the path is straight by construction rather than by luck.

    Position is interpolated linearly and orientation by shortest-arc slerp, so the
    waypoints lie on the direct path; they add no distance, only structure.

    Falls back to the single direct move the moment a leg refuses, so this can only
    change *how* a reachable target is reached, never *whether* it is. A refused leg
    executes nothing and costs no step.

    Args:
        env, planner, task: as everywhere.
        target: the final TCP pose.
        who, stage: for the trace.
        legs: waypoints including the target. 1 is the old behaviour. Each leg is a
            separately time-parameterised trajectory that decelerates to a stop, so
            more legs means more stop-start and more torso correction — 2 is the
            measured compromise between that and letting a long plan wander.
        bow: how far the curve is lifted off the straight chord, as a fraction of
            the chord length. **0, and measured.** A curved path was tried at 0.12
            on the hover and the dip and took the pair to 0/2: those two moves are
            near-vertical, so bowing them upward fights the motion instead of
            rounding it, and the arc puts the cup where the bucket rim is. The
            parameter stays because the argument for curving is sound for a long
            *horizontal* transfer — it is the wrong tool for these two stages.

    Why: `rotate_base_z` sweeps the turn's arc for collisions **with the attached
    object** (K51), and with the arm stretched out after a lift the held object
    can genuinely sweep through furniture. The object is pulled in: TCP at
    `base + ahead·face` (inside the base's footprint), at the TCP's current height,
    the object kept upright — its current orientation first, then the TCP yawed
    about the world's z axis by each entry of `yaws_deg` (the object stays vertical
    under a yaw); one `static_manipulation` per candidate with
    `disable_lift_joint=True` so the torso is not spent on the tuck; the first
    candidate that plans is executed. A candidate that does not plan costs no
    step (the solver executes nothing on a refused plan).

    History: until K53 (T5, 2026-08-18) this was a *recovery* only (D13) — under
    mplib 0.2.1's attached-body frame error (the held cup drawn 3.296 m off at
    shoulder_pan+90°) the tuck itself was unplannable on both calibration seeds:
    the held orientation on a real `shoulder_lift` limit, every upright
    reorientation on phantom collisions. With the frame fixed the reorientations
    plan (measured for the shipped set at 0.25 m ahead, `tools/probes/t5_carry_yaws.py`:
    RRT Success at yaw +90 / −90 / 180, the held orientation still on the real
    limit; `t3_carry_reach.py`'s +90/+135/+180 at 0.3–0.4 m agree), so the carry is
    a full stage again in the burner and the season-dish oracles: between the lift
    and the drive.

    After the move the grasp is verified with `task.agent.is_grasping(obj)`; no
    candidate planning, or a slipped object, is an honest `-1` ("carry pose
    unreachable") — a grasp/plan failure before any decision, per D6. A horizon cut
    is returned as the truncated tuple.

            inside the Fetch base's ~0.3 m footprint).
        after: a refusal this tuck is recovering from, e.g. the `rotation sweep
            hits …` text; when given, the *one* `FAILED:` line a refused tuck emits
            is the chained `carry pose unreachable after: …`.

        upright: try a levelled orientation basis before the as-held one (K55,

    # That measurement was of the wrong thing. Plan rate is not the outcome; keeping the
    # cup is. Interleaved, the sweep produced **2 `object slipped out on the way in` in
    # 16 episodes where the ordered ladder produced 0 in 30** — seeds 0 and 25, both
    # previously successful, both lost at a tuck that planned.
    #
    # The mechanism: a refused rung costs no steps, so reordering cannot change the pose
    # the surviving rung starts from — what it changes is *which* rung survives. The
    # rare levelled winner (yaw 90 planned 3 times in 30 episodes) is the one that tucks
    # a **levelled** cup; promoting as-held substitutes a rung that carries the cup's
    # pour tilt in through the base, and a 2.75 cm rim grasp does not survive that. The
    # dead rungs are the price of reaching the safe winner, not waste to be optimised
    # out.
    #
    # Inside a basis, each `lifts_m` height gets the full yaw ladder — a refused
    # rung is free, and the raised tuck is the season-dish held-out fallback that
    # runs only after every yaw at the current height has refused. The failure
    # form `tried_yaw_lift` counts lifts × yaws per basis.

    blocks the next drive's rotate; a branch line that flakes (arm_vs_rest > 1.0
    after it) gets one full retry round from a re-screwed start. Non-fatal, like
    the fold it replaces: the return value is the screw's, and the caller reads
    `arm_vs_rest` from qpos if it needs the truth.

    Args:
        env, planner: as everywhere.
        task: `env.unwrapped`.
        rest_tcp: the rest TCP pose IN THE BASE FRAME, captured at solve start
            (`base_link.pose.sp.inv() * tcp.pose.sp` with the arm still on the
            reset keyframe), so the re-basing is exact under any dock yaw.
        stage: prefix for the trace lines.
        who: the oracle's tag for `say`.
        rest_torso: the un-duck target (`REST_TORSO`, the rest keyframe's lift).

    Returns:
        The screw's result: the gym 5-tuple, or -1 when both draws refused.

    Example:
        >>> rest_tcp = task.agent.base_link.pose.sp.inv() * task.agent.tcp.pose.sp  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> ...                                                                   # doctest: +SKIP
