"""SHARED base for the cabinet-retrieval family — registers NOTHING.

The convention is one scene file = one registered task, and a task file may
not import another task's file (the registration side effect —
docs/review-inherited-code.md §12). A variant family therefore keeps its
machinery here, in a module named in SHARED_SCENE_MODULES, and each variant's
own file holds only its config override and its @register_env line.

MikasaCabinetRetrieval-v0: take the cup out of the opened wall cabinet, put it down.

The first motor-only task in this package — every other registered task is a memory
task (AGENTS.md: "memory is the point"). This one is deliberately built as the
*substrate* for a memory variant rather than an exception to the rule: the door
angle is a config field (a later variant closes it and adds the arc-pull), the
place target is a named per-episode point (a later variant can make it "where it
was"), and nothing in the observation names the answer-shaped facts. The design
blank naming those hooks is docs/task-designs/F-cabinetretrieval-v0.md.

Everything geometric here is measured, not assumed, and the measurement is W13
(tools/probes/w13_cabinet_take.py, journal 2026-08-28): the door holds where it is
put; the cabinet floor is real at z = 1.4200; a vertical top grasp NEVER plans
through the opening (0/9 — the first grid said otherwise and every 'plan' was a
phantom return from the solver's truncation guard); the horizontal side grasp
plans, holds, and the full chain ends with the cup standing on the counter.

Scene: kitchen 102 (scene_idx=0, pinned). The wall cabinet `cab_main` hangs over
`counter_main` at x [1.75, 2.75], box z [1.39, 2.31]; its right door — the one W12
measured opening — exposes the right half, x [2.25, 2.75], which sits over the
sink-free counter span. The cup spawns on the cabinet's interior floor inside that
half; the robot starts on the open floor south of the counter row.
